The data for the 40, 80 and 160 bus routes in the thesis experiments can be replicated from the data provided for the 20 bus routes in the TandemData.7Z zip file, which contains the dataset for the crosstown validation as well as the dataset for the distance mapping validation. The time range of the dataset is from 7:00 AM to 2:00 PM of a day.
