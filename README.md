# TandemDetection
The data for bus routes 40, 80 and 160 in the thesis experiments can be copied from the data for 20 bus routes provided in the TandemData.7Z zip file, which contains the crosstown pattern detection method validation dataset and the distance mapping method validation dataset. The time range of the dataset is from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. each day.
